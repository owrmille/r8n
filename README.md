# r8n - Microservices Platform

## Description

**You don't need everyone's opinion. You need the right people's opinion.**

**r8n** platform lets you build a personal network of trusted reviewers — friends, food critics you follow, colleagues with similar taste — and see only their honest takes on restaurants and cafés. Reviews are private by design, shared only on request, which means they're protected under German law and can never be forced down.

**r8n** is a scalable microservices-based platform built with Spring Boot, Kotlin, and React, designed to demonstrate modern software architecture patterns and distributed systems principles. The platform implements a multi-service architecture with an API Gateway and core business logic services, all communicating via HTTP/HTTPS with TLS encryption.

### Goals
- Demonstrate microservices architecture patterns
- Implement API-first design methodology
- Create a feature-rich, interactive web application
- Apply modern development practices (CI/CD, containerization, component-organized frontend)
- Fulfill 42 curriculum requirements for web development

### Key Features
- **Multi-service Backend**: Gateway, Opinions, Users, Messaging, Migration, and Mock services with clear separation of concerns
- **API-First Design**: Separate API contracts from implementation for clear service boundaries
- **Secure Communication**: TLS/SSL encryption between services
- **Database Management**: PostgreSQL with isolated schemas per service
- **Modern Frontend**: React application with TypeScript, TanStack Query for server state
- **Containerized Deployment**: Docker Compose setup for easy local development and production
- **Developer Experience**: Makefile targets for common operations, IDE setup guides

## Instructions

### Prerequisites

**Backend:**
- JDK 21 (`java --version` should show 21.x)
- Docker & Docker Compose (for containerized deployment)
- Make (for build automation)

**Frontend:**
- Node.js 22.13.0 or higher (`node -v` should show >= 22.13.0)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

**Version Control:**
- Git

> **⚠️ 42 Campus machines:** Campus machines do not have enough disk space to build or deploy this project directly from your home directory.
>
> **Setup steps for campus:**
> 1. Clone the repository into `/sgoinfre/<your_login>/` — not into `$HOME`
> 2. Run `make move-caches-to-goinfre` to move Docker and Gradle caches out of `$HOME` to `/goinfre`
> 3. Proceed with the regular setup below — `make docker-up` will handle the rest
>
> Check required disk space with `make who-ate-all-the-space`.

### Installation

**1. Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd r8n
```

**2. Backend setup:**
```bash
cd backend
./gradlew build
cd ..
```

**3. Frontend setup:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm ci
cd ..
```

**4. Environment configuration:**
- For Docker: Copy and configure `deployment/config/docker.env` and `deployment/secrets/docker.secrets.env`
- For local: Ensure `deployment/config/local.env` exists (it should by default)

### Running the Application

#### Option 1: Local Development (HTTP - No SSL)

**Start backend services:**
```bash
# In terminal 1
make local-run-all
```

**Start frontend:**
```bash
# In terminal 2
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

**Access:**
- Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- Gateway API: http://localhost:8080
- Opinions service: http://localhost:8081

#### Option 2: Docker/Production (HTTPS with TLS)

**Build and start all services:**
```bash
make docker-up
```

**Access:**
- Frontend: https://localhost (Nginx on port 443)
- Gateway API: https://localhost:8080
- Other services: Internal only (HTTPS)

**Stop services:**
```bash
make docker-down
```

### Database Setup

**Create database schema:**
```bash
make docker-database-run
```

**Connect to database:**
```bash
make docker-database-connect
# Then: \c r8n
# Then: \dt (to see tables)
```

### AI Usage Documentation

AI was used throughout the development process as an active coding assistant, not just for documentation.

**Development workflow:**
1. Ask AI to propose an idiomatic solution for a given problem
2. Read, understand, and make design choices
3. Implement a vertical stack manually, defining all layers
4. Ask AI for code review and suggestions
5. Iterate on the implementation
6. Ask AI to apply the same pattern to other components

**Specific tasks where AI assistance was used:**
- **Architecture documentation**: Analysis of multi-module structure, creation of ARCHITECTURE.md
- **Git workflow recovery**: Removing accidentally committed binary database files
- **README restructuring**: Restructuring and expansion to meet 42 curriculum requirements

```

### Relationships

**opinions schema:**

- **subjects** → **referents**: Many-to-One (each subject links to one referent — e.g. a restaurant)
- **opinions** → **opinion_notes**: One-to-Many
- **opinions** → **weighted_opinion_references**: One-to-Many (as parent and as child — opinions reference other opinions with a weight)

**users schema:**
